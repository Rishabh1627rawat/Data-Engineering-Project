# üìä Stock Sentiment Correlation Data Pipeline

This is an end-to-end automated data engineering project designed to **analyze and visualize how stock values of top 5 technology companies correlate with news article sentiments**. It simulates a real-world pipeline, featuring cloud integration, data orchestration, and reporting.

## üöÄ Project Objective

To build an automated and scalable data pipeline that:
- Extracts stock price data and news articles.
- Processes and cleanses the data.
- Analyzes sentiment from news headlines.
- Joins both datasets to observe correlation.
- Visualizes insights in a dashboard.
